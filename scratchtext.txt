    
# LAST STEP: Take:
# - theory quantiles
# - 1/2 function of quantiles
# ... and find the first mu, sigma values
# ... and maybe also 
# and THEN construct the final Theta_squiggle, using theory_q, sigma, mu!

# Where At: here! See above!


I will directly quote from the authors' working paper frequently, and focus my time on writing code. Future iterations of this will flesh out discussion and description further.
